This assignment is done by using python 3.6.
The libraries required for this assignment is matplotlib.image, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, sys

To run the k-means algorithm:
Please go to the directory, where all codes are available
Open the command prompt of that directory
Then run the following command as :
K_value = 2,5,10,15,20
For Koala:
     >> python kmeans_koala.py [K_value]
For Penguin:
  >> python kmeans_penguine.py [K_value]

For eg: python kmeans_koala.py 2
The above program runs the kmeans algorithm on koala image with the value of K = 2.
